        <p1> 
                I have 198 video games left, which are a mixture of Retro, First Preson Shooter, Indie, and MMORPGs. I have displayed them using a variety of statistics which can be seen below.

                <h2>Keyboard controls</h2>
                <p1> I made a program where there was a block on the screen that took keyboard inputs and used them to move the block around

                <h2>Pong</h2>
                <p1> I recreated the famous game pong, using the p5 database along with java script. It was slightly buggy at first but it now functions like regular pong, just more colorful.

                <p1> I used Html and CSS to create a webpage for a generic fictional watch company.
